  abstract = {The present effort employs a new archival approach to study values and value- behavior relations, which is likely to be particularly useful in applied settings. A value lexicon was developed on the basis of the Schwartz (1992) value theory to extract lexical indicators of values from texts. The convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of this measure was established using American newspaper content from 1900 to 2000 vis-{\`a}-vis existing self-report measures of values and objective indicators of value-expressive behaviors. Results provide empirical support for the use of the value lexicon to study values and value- behavior relations. First, the value lexicon demonstrated convergence with self-report responses of values. Second, values in American newspapers were associated with objective indicators of their corresponding value-expressive behaviors compared with noncorresponding value- expressive behaviors. Third, patterns of values over this 101-year period exhibited meaningful fluctuations with major historical and political events. The discussion describes new possibilities for future research on values in many applied settings with the value lexicon. The discussion also suggests that the principles of the value lexicon could be adopted to measure other psychological constructs of interest to applied psychology.},

We measured the 10 value constructs in the theory with the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ), a new and less abstract method. Analyses in representative samples in South Africa (n = 3,210) and Italy (n = 5,867) and in samples of 13- to 14-year-old Ugandan girls (n = 840) yielded structures of relations among values similar to the theoretical prototype. In an Israeli student sample (n = 200), the values exhibited convergent and discriminant validity when measured with the PVQ and with the standard value survey. Predicted relations of value priorities with a set of 10 background, personality, attitude, and behavioral variables in the four samples supported the construct validity of the values theory with an alternative method of measurement.},

  title = {Normative Foundations for Well-Being Policy},
  abstract = {This paper examines the normative principles that should guide policies aimed at promoting happiness or, more broadly, well-being. After arguing that well-being policy is both legitimate and necessary, we lay out a case for "pragmatic subjectivism": given widely accepted principles of respect for persons, well-being policy may not assume any view of well-being, subjectivist or objectivist. Rather it should promote what its intended beneficiaries see as good for them: pleasure for hedonists, excellence for Aristotelians, etc. Specifically, well-being policy should promote citizens' "personal welfare values": those values\textemdash{}and not mere preferences\textemdash{}that individuals' see as bearing on their well-being. We suggest a variety of means for determining what people value, but conclude that there is no canonical means of doing this: there will often be some indeterminacy about what people value. Finally, we consider how pragmatic subjectivism works in practice, arguing that headline measures of well-being should include subjective well-being\textemdash{}given that it is so widely and deeply valued\textemdash{}and perhaps other values as well.},

abstract = {This paper concerns efficient matrix-free finite-element algorithms on modern manycore processors such as graphics cards (GPUs) as an alternative to sparse matrix-vector products. In matrix-free finite element algorithms, the assembly and solution phases are merged, yielding a significantly lower memory bandwidth footprint, with a corresponding increase in efficiency on bandwidth limited processors. Additionally, no system matrix must be assembled or stored in memory.We present a GPU parallelization of the matrix-free method including a novel algorithm for resolving hanging-node constraints on the GPU, capable of simulation on adaptively refined grids. For second-order elements and higher in 3D, our GPU implementation of the adaptive algorithm is between 1.8 and 2.3 times faster than an existing optimized CPU version, on comparable hardware. Compared to a matrix-based implementation using CUSPARSE, we get a speedup of 8 and can solve problems 8 times larger in 3D.},

abstract = "In recent years, parallel processing has been widely used in the computer industry. Software developers, have to deal with parallel computing platforms and technologies to provide novel and rich experiences. We present a novel algorithm to solve dense linear systems using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). High-level linear algebra operations require intensive computation. In this study Graphics Processing Units (GPU) accelerated implementation of LU linear algebra routine is implemented. LU decomposition is a decomposition of the form A=LU where A is a square matrix. The main idea of the LU decomposition is to record the steps used in Gaussian elimination on A in the places where the zero is produced. L and U are lower and upper triangular matrices respectively. This means that L has only zeros above the diagonal and U has only zeros below the diagonal. We have worked to increase performance with proper data representation and reducing row operations on GPU. Because of the high arithmetic throughput of GPUs, initial results from experiments promised a bright future for GPU computing. It has been shown useful for scientific computations. GPUs have high memory bandwidth and more floating point units as compared to the CPU. We have tried our study on different systems that have different GPUs and CPUs. The computation studies were also evaluated for different linear systems. When we compared the results obtained from both systems, a better performance was obtained with GPU computing. According to results, GPU computation approximately worked 3 times faster than the CPU computation. Our implementation provides significant performance improvement so we can easily use it to solve dense linear system."

The Tokyo metropolitan area is densely populated, subject to strong shaking from a diversity of earthquake sources, and sits atop the deep Kanto sedimentary basin. It is also instrumented with two seismic arrays: the dense MEtropolitan Seismic Observation network (MeSO-net) within the basin, and the High sensitivity seismograph network (Hi-net) surrounding it. In this study, we explore the 3-D seismic wavefield within and throughout the Kanto basin, including near and across basin boundaries, using cross-correlations of all components of ambient seismic field between the stations of these two arrays. Dense observations allow us to observe clearly the propagation of three modes of both Rayleigh and Love waves. They also show how the wavefield behaves in the vicinity of sharp basin edges with reflected/converted waves and excitation of higher modes.}",

abstract = {GPU-accelerated computing is becoming a popular technology due to the emergence of techniques such as OpenACC, which makes it easy to port codes in their original form to GPU systems using compiler directives, and thereby speeding up computation times relatively simply. In this study we have developed an OpenACC implementation of the high order finite difference CFD solver ESSENSE for simulating compressible flows. The solver is based on summation-by-part form difference operators, and the boundary and interface conditions are weakly implemented using simultaneous approximation terms. This case study focuses on porting code to GPUs for the most time-consuming parts namely sparse matrix vector multiplications and the evaluations of fluxes. The resulting OpenACC implementation is used to simulate the Taylor-Green vortex which produces a maximum speed-up of 61.3 on a single V100 GPU by compared to serial CPU version.},

   abstract = "Understanding the partitioning of seismic and aseismic fault slip is central to seismotectonics as it ultimately determines the seismic potential of faults. Thanks to advances in tectonic geodesy, it is now possible to develop kinematic models of the spatiotemporal evolution of slip over the seismic cycle and to determine the budget of seismic and aseismic slip. Studies of subduction zones and continental faults have shown that aseismic creep is common and sometimes prevalent within the seismogenic depth range. Interseismic coupling is generally observed to be spatially heterogeneous, defining locked patches of stress accumulation, to be released in future earthquakes or aseismic transients, surrounded by creeping areas. Clay-rich tectonites, high temperature, and elevated pore-fluid pressure seem to be key factors promoting aseismic creep. The generally logarithmic time evolution of afterslip is a distinctive feature of creeping faults that suggests a logarithmic dependency of fault friction on slip rate, as observed in laboratory friction experiments. Most faults can be considered to be paved with interlaced patches where the friction law is either rate-strengthening, inhibiting seismic rupture propagation, or rate-weakening, allowing for earthquake nucleation. The rate-weakening patches act as asperities on which stress builds up in the interseismic period; they might rupture collectively in a variety of ways. The pattern of interseismic coupling can help constrain the return period of the maximum- magnitude earthquake based on the requirement that seismic and aseismic slip sum to match long-term slip. Dynamic models of the seismic cycle based on this conceptual model can be tuned to reproduce geodetic and seismological observations. The promise and pitfalls of using such models to assess seismic hazard are discussed.",

abstract = {Direct shear experiments on ground surfaces of a granodiorite from Raymond, California, at normal stresses of ∼6 MPa demonstrate that competing time, displacement, and velocity effects control rock friction. It is proposed that the strength of the population of points of contacts between sliding surfaces determines frictional strength and that the population of contacts changes continuously with displacements. Previous experiments demonstrate that the strength of the contacts increases with the age of the contacts. The present experiments establish that a characteristic displacement, proportional to surface roughness, is required to change the population of contacts. Hence during slip the average age of the points of contact and therefore frictional strength decrease as slip velocity increases. Displacement weakening and consequently the potential for unstable slip occur whenever displacement reduces the average age of the contacts. In addition to this velocity dependency, which arises from displacement dependency and time dependency, the experiments also show a competing but transient increase in friction whenever slip velocity increases. Creep of the sliding surface at stresses below that for steady state slip is also observed. Constitutive relationships are developed that permit quantitative simulation of the friction versus displacement data as a function of surface roughness and for different time and velocity histories. Unstable slip in experiments is controlled by these constitutive effects and by the stiffness of the experimental system. It is argued that analogous properties control earthquake instability.},

abstract = {The constitutive relations developed in the companion paper are used to model detailed observations of preseismic slip and the onset of unstable slip in biaxial laboratory experiments. The simulations employ a deterministic plane strain finite element model to represent the interactions both within the sliding blocks and between the blocks and the loading apparatus. Both experiments and simulations show that preseismic slip is controlled by initial inhomogeneity of shear stress along the sliding surface relative to the frictional strength. As a consequence of the inhomogeneity, stable slip begins at a point on the surface and the area of slip slowly expands as the external loading increases. A previously proposed correlation between accelerating rates of stable slip and growth of the area of slip is supported by the simulations. In the simulations and in the experiments, unstable slip occurs shortly after a propagating slip event traverses the sliding surface and breaks out at the ends of the sample. In the model the breakout of stable slip causes a sudden acceleration of slip rates. Because of velocity dependency of the constitutive relationship for friction, the rapid acceleration of slip causes a decrease in frictional strength. Instability occurs when the frictional strength decreases with displacement at a rate that exceeds the intrinsic unloading characteristics of the sample and test machine. A simple slider-spring model that does not consider preseismic slip appears to approximate the transition adequately from stable sliding to unstable slip as a function of normal stress, machine stiffness, and surface roughness for small samples. However, for large samples and for natural faults the simulations suggest that the simple model may be inaccurate because it does not take into account potentially large preseismic displacements that will alter the friction parameters prior to instability.},

The friction state variable is discussed, including its interpretation as a measure of average asperity contact time and porosity within granular fault gouge. Data are summarized showing that friction evolves even during truly stationary contact, and the connection between modern friction laws and the concept of “static” friction is discussed. Measurements of frictional healing, as evidenced by increasing static friction during quasistationary contact, are reviewed, as are their implications for fault healing. Shear localization in fault gouge is discussed, and the relationship between microstructures and friction is reviewed. These data indicate differences in the behavior of bare rock surfaces as compared to shear within granular fault gouge that can be attributed to dilation within fault gouge. Physical models for the characteristic friction distance are discussed and related to the problem of scaling this parameter to seismic faults. Earthquake afterslip, its relation to laboratory friction data, and the inverse correlation between afterslip and shallow coseismic slip are discussed in the context of a model for afterslip. Recent observations of the absence of afterslip are predicted by the model.",

abstract = {The dependence of the friction force on slip history is described by an experimentally motivated constitutive law where the friction force is dependent on slip rate and state variables. The state variables are defined macroscopically by evolution equations for their rates of change in terms of their present values and slip rate. Experiments may strongly suggest that one state variable is adequate or prove that one is inadequate. Analysis of steady slip governed by a single state variable in a spring and (massless) slider predict oscillations at a critical spring stiffness k = kcrit. The critical stiffness kcrit is given by a simple formula and steady slip is stable for k > kcrit and unstable for k < kcrit. State variable friction laws may superficially appear as a simple slip rate dependence, slip distance dependence, or time dependent static friction, depending on experiment and testing machinery. Truly complicated motion is possible in a spring-slider model if more than one state variable is used. Further consequences of state variable friction laws can include creep waves and apparent rate independence for some phenomena.},
