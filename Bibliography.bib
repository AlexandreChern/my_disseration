title = {The physics of earthquakes},
journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {Earthquakes occur as a result of global plate motion. However, this simple picture is far from complete. Some plate boundaries glide past each other smoothly, while others are punctuated by catastrophic failures. Some earthquakes stop after only a few hundred metres while others continue rupturing for a thousand kilometres. Earthquakes are sometimes triggered by other large earthquakes thousands of kilometres away. We address these questions by dissecting the observable phenomena and separating out the quantifiable features for comparison across events. We begin with a discussion of stress in the crust followed by an overview of earthquake phenomenology, focusing on the parameters that are readily measured by current seismic techniques. We briefly discuss how these parameters are related to the amplitude and frequencies of the elastic waves measured by seismometers as well as direct geodetic measurements of the Earth's deformation. We then review the major processes thought to be active during the rupture and discuss their relation to the observable parameters. We then take a longer range view by discussing how earthquakes interact as a complex system. Finally, we combine subjects to approach the key issue of earthquake initiation. This concluding discussion will require using the processes introduced in the study of rupture as well as some novel mechanisms. As our observational database improves, our computational ability accelerates and our laboratories become more refined, the next few decades promise to bring more insights on earthquakes and perhaps some answers.}

    abstract = "{Although prediction of failure of rocks may be ultimately possible without knowing in detail how failure occurs, understanding of this process is certainly of fundamental interest in rock mechanics. Of the various failure mechanisms, probably brittle fracture is of greatest interest. Recent reviews have brought this subject nearly up to date (Hoek, 1 Price, 2 and Jaeger 3) and here, we summarize certain recent developments. As our understanding of brittle fracture is derived almost solely from laboratory studies this will amount to a review of certain laboratory experiments. New studies in four areas are pertinent; these concern 1) the volume changes which accompany brittle fracture, 2) the propagation of cracks in compression, 3) certain frictional characteristics of rocks and minerals at high pressure,  and 4 ) the law of effective stress for crystalline rocks. Our objective here is less to present an entirely consistent, complete picture of how a rock fractures than it is to emphasize gaps in our understanding and, thus, suggest areas that need further study. Progress is still painfully slow in this field and perhaps this approach will stimulate new work.Although the behavior of large rock masses is most often the concern in rock mechanics, the number of large-scale experimental tests is still vanishingly small. Our experimental observations are, by and large, still made on small, relatively flaw-free, rock samples. Here also we report the behavior of small samples.Bridgman4, Handin, et al., 5 and Brace, et al. 6 have described a widespread characteristic of rocks, namely, a tendency to dilate, or increase in volume, just before fracture. This has been observed for a wide variety of rock types, for ductile rocks like. Soapstone and marble as well as for brittle rocks such as quartzite and granite, for crack-free, compact rocks such as diabase, as well as for loose and even somewhat porous rocks. Measurements of volume change in a sample under stress have been made in three different ways. First, volume change may be obtained from measurement of the three principal linear strains. This technique was used by Brace, et al. 6 and Matsushima. 7,8.  Bridgman 4 and Brace (unpublished work) observed changes in total volume of a specimen through changes in volume of a fluid in which the specimen was submerged; Bridgman's samples were unjacketed, whereas Brace's were jacketed. By the third method, actual changes in the pore volume of a pervious rock are observed (Handin, et al., 5 and Brace, unpublished work). The third method gives just the changes in pore volume; the first and second give elastic volume changes as well.Typical curves of stress vs volumetric strain using the first or second method are given in Fig. 1 for granite and marble at several pressures. At 4.11 kb confining pressure the stress-volumetries train curve of granite is fairly typical of behavior over the pressure range 1 to 10 kb. Deformation is at first elastic; the curve is nearly straight with a reciprocal slope close to the linear compressibility of the rock.}",

  abstract = {The present effort employs a new archival approach to study values and value- behavior relations, which is likely to be particularly useful in applied settings. A value lexicon was developed on the basis of the Schwartz (1992) value theory to extract lexical indicators of values from texts. The convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of this measure was established using American newspaper content from 1900 to 2000 vis-{\`a}-vis existing self-report measures of values and objective indicators of value-expressive behaviors. Results provide empirical support for the use of the value lexicon to study values and value- behavior relations. First, the value lexicon demonstrated convergence with self-report responses of values. Second, values in American newspapers were associated with objective indicators of their corresponding value-expressive behaviors compared with noncorresponding value- expressive behaviors. Third, patterns of values over this 101-year period exhibited meaningful fluctuations with major historical and political events. The discussion describes new possibilities for future research on values in many applied settings with the value lexicon. The discussion also suggests that the principles of the value lexicon could be adopted to measure other psychological constructs of interest to applied psychology.},

In an Israeli student sample (n = 200), the values exhibited convergent and discriminant validity when measured with the PVQ and with the standard value survey. Predicted relations of value priorities with a set of 10 background, personality, attitude, and behavioral variables in the four samples supported the construct validity of the values theory with an alternative method of measurement.},

After arguing that well-being policy is both legitimate and necessary, we lay out a case for "pragmatic subjectivism": given widely accepted principles of respect for persons, well-being policy may not assume any view of well-being, subjectivist or objectivist. Rather it should promote what its intended beneficiaries see as good for them: pleasure for hedonists, excellence for Aristotelians, etc. Specifically, well-being policy should promote citizens' "personal welfare values": those values\textemdash{}and not mere preferences\textemdash{}that individuals' see as bearing on their well-being. We suggest a variety of means for determining what people value, but conclude that there is no canonical means of doing this: there will often be some indeterminacy about what people value. Finally, we consider how pragmatic subjectivism works in practice, arguing that headline measures of well-being should include subjective well-being\textemdash{}given that it is so widely and deeply valued\textemdash{}and perhaps other values as well.},

abstract = {On multicore systems contention for shared resources occurs when memory-intensive threads are co-scheduled on cores that share parts of the memory hierarchy, such as last-level caches and memory controllers. Previous work investigated how contention could be addressed via scheduling. A contention-aware scheduler separates competing threads onto separate memory hierarchy domains to eliminate resource sharing and, as a consequence, mitigate contention. However, all previous work on contention-aware scheduling assumed that the underlying system is UMA (uniform memory access latencies, single memory controller). Modern multicore systems, however, are NUMA, which means that they feature non-uniform memory access latencies and multiple memory controllers. We discovered that contention management is a lot more difficult on NUMA systems, because the scheduler must not only consider the placement of threads, but also the placement of their memory. This is mostly required to eliminate contention for memory controllers contrary to the popular belief that remote access latency is the dominant concern. In this work we quantify the effects on performance imposed by resource contention and remote access latency. This analysis inspires the design of a contention-aware scheduling algorithm for NUMA systems. This algorithm significantly outperforms a NUMA-unaware algorithm proposed before as well as the default Linux scheduler. We also investigate memory migration strategies, which are the necessary part of the NUMA contention-aware scheduling algorithm. Finally, we propose and evaluate a new contention management algorithm that is priority-aware.},

abstract = {This paper concerns efficient matrix-free finite-element algorithms on modern manycore processors such as graphics cards (GPUs) as an alternative to sparse matrix-vector products. In matrix-free finite element algorithms, the assembly and solution phases are merged, yielding a significantly lower memory bandwidth footprint, with a corresponding increase in efficiency on bandwidth limited processors. Additionally, no system matrix must be assembled or stored in memory.We present a GPU parallelization of the matrix-free method including a novel algorithm for resolving hanging-node constraints on the GPU, capable of simulation on adaptively refined grids. For second-order elements and higher in 3D, our GPU implementation of the adaptive algorithm is between 1.8 and 2.3 times faster than an existing optimized CPU version, on comparable hardware. Compared to a matrix-based implementation using CUSPARSE, we get a speedup of 8 and can solve problems 8 times larger in 3D.},

abstract = "In recent years, parallel processing has been widely used in the computer industry. Software developers, have to deal with parallel computing platforms and technologies to provide novel and rich experiences. We present a novel algorithm to solve dense linear systems using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). High-level linear algebra operations require intensive computation. In this study Graphics Processing Units (GPU) accelerated implementation of LU linear algebra routine is implemented. LU decomposition is a decomposition of the form A=LU where A is a square matrix. The main idea of the LU decomposition is to record the steps used in Gaussian elimination on A in the places where the zero is produced. L and U are lower and upper triangular matrices respectively. This means that L has only zeros above the diagonal and U has only zeros below the diagonal. We have worked to increase performance with proper data representation and reducing row operations on GPU. Because of the high arithmetic throughput of GPUs, initial results from experiments promised a bright future for GPU computing. It has been shown useful for scientific computations. GPUs have high memory bandwidth and more floating point units as compared to the CPU. We have tried our study on different systems that have different GPUs and CPUs. The computation studies were also evaluated for different linear systems. When we compared the results obtained from both systems, a better performance was obtained with GPU computing. According to results, GPU computation approximately worked 3 times faster than the CPU computation. Our implementation provides significant performance improvement so we can easily use it to solve dense linear system."

The Tokyo metropolitan area is densely populated, subject to strong shaking from a diversity of earthquake sources, and sits atop the deep Kanto sedimentary basin. It is also instrumented with two seismic arrays: the dense MEtropolitan Seismic Observation network (MeSO-net) within the basin, and the High sensitivity seismograph network (Hi-net) surrounding it. In this study, we explore the 3-D seismic wavefield within and throughout the Kanto basin, including near and across basin boundaries, using cross-correlations of all components of ambient seismic field between the stations of these two arrays. Dense observations allow us to observe clearly the propagation of three modes of both Rayleigh and Love waves. They also show how the wavefield behaves in the vicinity of sharp basin edges with reflected/converted waves and excitation of higher modes.}",

abstract = {GPU-accelerated computing is becoming a popular technology due to the emergence of techniques such as OpenACC, which makes it easy to port codes in their original form to GPU systems using compiler directives, and thereby speeding up computation times relatively simply. In this study we have developed an OpenACC implementation of the high order finite difference CFD solver ESSENSE for simulating compressible flows. The solver is based on summation-by-part form difference operators, and the boundary and interface conditions are weakly implemented using simultaneous approximation terms. This case study focuses on porting code to GPUs for the most time-consuming parts namely sparse matrix vector multiplications and the evaluations of fluxes. The resulting OpenACC implementation is used to simulate the Taylor-Green vortex which produces a maximum speed-up of 61.3 on a single V100 GPU by compared to serial CPU version.},

   abstract = "Understanding the partitioning of seismic and aseismic fault slip is central to seismotectonics as it ultimately determines the seismic potential of faults. Thanks to advances in tectonic geodesy, it is now possible to develop kinematic models of the spatiotemporal evolution of slip over the seismic cycle and to determine the budget of seismic and aseismic slip. Studies of subduction zones and continental faults have shown that aseismic creep is common and sometimes prevalent within the seismogenic depth range. Interseismic coupling is generally observed to be spatially heterogeneous, defining locked patches of stress accumulation, to be released in future earthquakes or aseismic transients, surrounded by creeping areas. Clay-rich tectonites, high temperature, and elevated pore-fluid pressure seem to be key factors promoting aseismic creep. The generally logarithmic time evolution of afterslip is a distinctive feature of creeping faults that suggests a logarithmic dependency of fault friction on slip rate, as observed in laboratory friction experiments. Most faults can be considered to be paved with interlaced patches where the friction law is either rate-strengthening, inhibiting seismic rupture propagation, or rate-weakening, allowing for earthquake nucleation. The rate-weakening patches act as asperities on which stress builds up in the interseismic period; they might rupture collectively in a variety of ways. The pattern of interseismic coupling can help constrain the return period of the maximum- magnitude earthquake based on the requirement that seismic and aseismic slip sum to match long-term slip. Dynamic models of the seismic cycle based on this conceptual model can be tuned to reproduce geodetic and seismological observations. The promise and pitfalls of using such models to assess seismic hazard are discussed.",

abstract = {Direct shear experiments on ground surfaces of a granodiorite from Raymond, California, at normal stresses of ∼6 MPa demonstrate that competing time, displacement, and velocity effects control rock friction. It is proposed that the strength of the population of points of contacts between sliding surfaces determines frictional strength and that the population of contacts changes continuously with displacements. Previous experiments demonstrate that the strength of the contacts increases with the age of the contacts. The present experiments establish that a characteristic displacement, proportional to surface roughness, is required to change the population of contacts. Hence during slip the average age of the points of contact and therefore frictional strength decrease as slip velocity increases. Displacement weakening and consequently the potential for unstable slip occur whenever displacement reduces the average age of the contacts. In addition to this velocity dependency, which arises from displacement dependency and time dependency, the experiments also show a competing but transient increase in friction whenever slip velocity increases. Creep of the sliding surface at stresses below that for steady state slip is also observed. Constitutive relationships are developed that permit quantitative simulation of the friction versus displacement data as a function of surface roughness and for different time and velocity histories. Unstable slip in experiments is controlled by these constitutive effects and by the stiffness of the experimental system. It is argued that analogous properties control earthquake instability.},

abstract = {The constitutive relations developed in the companion paper are used to model detailed observations of preseismic slip and the onset of unstable slip in biaxial laboratory experiments. The simulations employ a deterministic plane strain finite element model to represent the interactions both within the sliding blocks and between the blocks and the loading apparatus. Both experiments and simulations show that preseismic slip is controlled by initial inhomogeneity of shear stress along the sliding surface relative to the frictional strength. As a consequence of the inhomogeneity, stable slip begins at a point on the surface and the area of slip slowly expands as the external loading increases. A previously proposed correlation between accelerating rates of stable slip and growth of the area of slip is supported by the simulations. In the simulations and in the experiments, unstable slip occurs shortly after a propagating slip event traverses the sliding surface and breaks out at the ends of the sample. In the model the breakout of stable slip causes a sudden acceleration of slip rates. Because of velocity dependency of the constitutive relationship for friction, the rapid acceleration of slip causes a decrease in frictional strength. Instability occurs when the frictional strength decreases with displacement at a rate that exceeds the intrinsic unloading characteristics of the sample and test machine. A simple slider-spring model that does not consider preseismic slip appears to approximate the transition adequately from stable sliding to unstable slip as a function of normal stress, machine stiffness, and surface roughness for small samples. However, for large samples and for natural faults the simulations suggest that the simple model may be inaccurate because it does not take into account potentially large preseismic displacements that will alter the friction parameters prior to instability.},

The friction state variable is discussed, including its interpretation as a measure of average asperity contact time and porosity within granular fault gouge. Data are summarized showing that friction evolves even during truly stationary contact, and the connection between modern friction laws and the concept of “static” friction is discussed. Measurements of frictional healing, as evidenced by increasing static friction during quasistationary contact, are reviewed, as are their implications for fault healing. Shear localization in fault gouge is discussed, and the relationship between microstructures and friction is reviewed. These data indicate differences in the behavior of bare rock surfaces as compared to shear within granular fault gouge that can be attributed to dilation within fault gouge. Physical models for the characteristic friction distance are discussed and related to the problem of scaling this parameter to seismic faults. Earthquake afterslip, its relation to laboratory friction data, and the inverse correlation between afterslip and shallow coseismic slip are discussed in the context of a model for afterslip. Recent observations of the absence of afterslip are predicted by the model.",

abstract = {The dependence of the friction force on slip history is described by an experimentally motivated constitutive law where the friction force is dependent on slip rate and state variables. The state variables are defined macroscopically by evolution equations for their rates of change in terms of their present values and slip rate. Experiments may strongly suggest that one state variable is adequate or prove that one is inadequate. Analysis of steady slip governed by a single state variable in a spring and (massless) slider predict oscillations at a critical spring stiffness k = kcrit. The critical stiffness kcrit is given by a simple formula and steady slip is stable for k > kcrit and unstable for k < kcrit. State variable friction laws may superficially appear as a simple slip rate dependence, slip distance dependence, or time dependent static friction, depending on experiment and testing machinery. Truly complicated motion is possible in a spring-slider model if more than one state variable is used. Further consequences of state variable friction laws can include creep waves and apparent rate independence for some phenomena.},

abstract = {The slip rate budget of the San Andreas fault (SAF) in central California, which is approximately 33 mm/yr, is accounted for by a change in the slip release mechanism along the fault. In the NW section of the fault, between Bear Valley and Monarch Peak, creep apparently accounts for the slip budget with the seismicity contributing negligibly. The section at Parkfield marks the transition from a creeping to a locked fault trace. Since the M8 1857 earthquake five M6 earthquakes have occurred but have not completely accounted for the slip budget. Southeast of Parkfield, the SAF has been locked since 1857. From Cholame to Bitterwater Valley this section now lags the deep slip by the amount of slip released in 1857; consequently faulting in this section could occur at the time of the next Parkfield earthquake. If this earthquake releases the slip deficit accumulated in the transition zone and in the locked zone, the earthquake will have a moment-magnitude M7.2.},

    abstract = "{Slip rupture processes on velocity-weakening faults have been found in simulations to occur by two basic modes, the expanding crack and self-healing modes. In the expanding crack mode, as the rupture zone on a fault keeps expanding, slip continues growing everywhere within the rupture. In the self-healing mode, rupture occurs as a slip pulse propagating along the fault, with cessation of slip behind the pulse, so that the slipping region occupies only a small width at the front of the expanding rupture zone.We discuss the determination of rupture mode for dynamic slip between elastic half-spaces that are uniformly prestressed at background loading level τb0 outside a perturbed zone where rupture is nucleated. The interface follows a rate and state law such that strength τstrength approaches a velocity-dependent steady-state value τss(V) for sustained slip at velocity V, where dτss(V)/dV ≦ 0 (velocity weakening). By proving a theorem on when a certain type of cracklike solution cannot exist, and by analyzing the results of 2D antiplane simulations of rupture propagation for different classes of constitutive laws, and for a wide range of parameters within each, we develop explanations of when one or the other mode of rupture will result. The explanation is given in terms of a critical stress level τpulse and a dimensionless velocity-weakening parameter T that is defined when τb0 ≥ τpulse. Here τpulse is the largest value of τb0 satisfying τb0 − (μ/2c)V ≤ τss(V) for all V \\&gt; 0, where μ is the shear modulus and c is the shear wave speed. Also, T = [−dτss(V)/dV]/(μ/2c) evaluated at V = Vdyna, which is the largest root of τb0 − (μ/2c)V = τss(V); T = 1 at τb0 = τpulse, and T diminishes toward 0 as τb0 is increased above τpulse.We thus show that the rupture mode is of the self-healing pulse type in the low-stress range, when τb0 \\&lt; τpulse or when τb0 is only slightly greater than τpulse, such that T is near unity (e.g., T \\&gt; 0.6). The amplitude of slip in the pulse diminishes with propagation distance at the lowest stress levels, whereas the amplitude increases for τb0 above a certain threshold τarrest, with τarrest \\&lt; τpulse in the cases examined. When τb0 is sufficiently higher than τpulse that T is near zero (e.g., T \\&lt; 0.4 in our 2D antiplane simulations), the rupture mode is that of an enlarging shear crack.Thus rupture under low stress is in the self-healing mode and under high stress in the cracklike mode, where our present work shows how to quantify low and high. The results therefore suggest the possibility that the self-healing mode is common for large natural ruptures because the stresses on faults are simply too low to allow the cracklike mode.}",

H-matrices, which are efficient low-rank compressed representations of dense matrices, enable more rapid arithmetic operations with less memory sizes. In this study, we constructed a friction model of quasi-dynamic earthquake cycles on a flat, dipping, plate interface in a semi-infinite homogeneous elastic medium, and investigated the effectiveness of H-matrices by changing N from 104 to 106. Construction of H-matrices involves several parameters controlling the structure and accuracy of the approximated matrix. With H-matrices using proper values for these parameters to maintain accuracy, except for smaller values of the parameter for suppressing the ranks of the outermost submatrices, the memory size of the matrix was reduced to about O(N). The computational time in the multiplication was also reduced to O(N) for a range of N values less than about 105, and to O(N) ∼ O(NlogN) for a larger range. Thus, we found that the application of H-matrices greatly reduces the computational time and memory size in earthquake cycle simulations. This advance should enable the realization of large- and multi-scale simulations with a million order cells and the estimation of frictional parameters.}

abstract = {A numerical simulation study is presented for the recurrence of great earthquakes and aseismic sliding in the Sanriku region, northeastern Japan, where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath northern Honshu and M8 class earthquakes have occurred approximately every 100 years. The friction on the plate interface is assumed to obey a rate- and state-dependent friction law, and the spatial distribution of constitutive parameters of the friction law is estimated, so that the simulated slip histories mimic those estimated from seismic and geodetic observations. By introducing two large asperities that have velocity-weakening frictional properties, earthquakes similar to the 1968 Tokachi-oki earthquake (Mw = 8.2) and the 1994 Sanriku-oki earthquake (Mw = 7.7) can be modeled. The former broke both the large asperities, and the latter broke one of them. The ruptures of the two simulated large earthquakes started from almost the same location, and their nucleation processes are similar to each other. Two smaller asperities were introduced to represent smaller earthquakes. One of the small asperities is for the largest aftershock (Mw = 6.9) of the 1994 Sanriku-oki earthquake, which was located westward from the 1994 main shock area and took place 10 d after the main shock. The present simulation suggests that the largest aftershock was triggered by stress caused by propagation of postseismic sliding. In the simulation, the area of greatest intensity of postseismic sliding is located in the region between the main shock slip area and the largest aftershock area, which is consistent with the estimation from GPS data analyses for the postseismic sliding of the 1994 Sanriku-oki earthquake. Some important characteristics of seismic and aseismic processes, as estimated from observations, are reproduced in the model. This suggests that spatially nonuniform frictional properties on the plate interface can be estimated to some extent by comparison between model results and observed data.},

Both of these activities are detected by NIED Hi-net, which is composed of densely distributed observatories equipped with a set of tiltmeter and a high-sensitivity seismograph. Since the short-term SSE is small in magnitude, GPS can detect only the long-term SSE. Some of these episodes have nearly the same surface deformation pattern. This shows the existence of `slow slip patches' on a plate interface, where the episodic slow slip is the characteristic slip behavior. We observe a change in periodicity and size of the short-term episode after the onset of the long-term SSE. Moreover, the long-term slow slip accelerates when the short-term activity takes place. This suggests that there is an interaction between these two types of SSEs.},

abstract = "Recently, the occurrence of slow earthquakes such as low-frequency earthquakes and very low-frequency earthquakes have been recognized at depths of about 30 km in southwest Japan and Cascadia. These slow earthquakes occur sometimes in isolation and sometimes break into chain-reaction, producing tremor that migrates at a speed of about 5-15 km/day and suggesting a strong interaction among nearby small asperities. In this study, we formulate a 3-D subduction plate boundary model with two types of small asperities chained along the trench at the depth of 30 km. Our simulation succeeds in representing various types of slow earthquakes including low-frequency earthquakes and rapid slip velocity in the same asperity, and indicates that interaction between asperities may cause the very low-frequency earthquakes. Our simulation also shows chain reaction along trench with propagation speed that can be made consistent with observations by adjusting model parameters, which suggests that the interactions also explain the observed migration of slow earthquakes.",

    abstract = { Accurate methods for the solution of the migration of zero‐offset seismic records have been developed. The numerical operations are defined in the frequency domain. The source and recorder positions are lowered by means of a phase shift, or a rotation of the phase angle of the Fourier coefficients. For applications with laterally invariant velocities, the equations governing the migration process are solved very accurately by the phase‐shift method. The partial differential equations considered include the 15 degree equation, as well as higher order approximations to the exact migration process. The most accurate migration is accomplished by using the asymptotic equation, whose dispersion relation is the same as that of the full wave equation for downward propagating waves. These equations, however, do not account for the reflection and transmission effects, multiples, or evanescent waves. For comparable accuracy, the present approach to migration is expected to be computationally more efficient than finite‐difference methods in general. }

abstract = {Multigrid schemes for high order finite difference methods on summation-by-parts form are studied by comparing the effect of different interpolation operators. By using the standard linear prolongation and restriction operators, the Galerkin condition leads to inaccurate coarse grid discretizations. In this paper, an alternative class of interpolation operators that bypass this issue and preserve the summation-by-parts property on each grid level is considered. Clear improvements of the convergence rate for relevant model problems are achieved.}

abstract = "In recent years, parallel processing has been widely used in the computer industry. Software developers, have to deal with parallel computing platforms and technologies to provide novel and rich experiences. We present a novel algorithm to solve dense linear systems using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). High-level linear algebra operations require intensive computation. In this study Graphics Processing Units (GPU) accelerated implementation of LU linear algebra routine is implemented. LU decomposition is a decomposition of the form A=LU where A is a square matrix. The main idea of the LU decomposition is to record the steps used in Gaussian elimination on A in the places where the zero is produced. L and U are lower and upper triangular matrices respectively. This means that L has only zeros above the diagonal and U has only zeros below the diagonal. We have worked to increase performance with proper data representation and reducing row operations on GPU. Because of the high arithmetic throughput of GPUs, initial results from experiments promised a bright future for GPU computing. It has been shown useful for scientific computations. GPUs have high memory bandwidth and more floating point units as compared to the CPU. We have tried our study on different systems that have different GPUs and CPUs. The computation studies were also evaluated for different linear systems. When we compared the results obtained from both systems, a better performance was obtained with GPU computing. According to results, GPU computation approximately worked 3 times faster than the CPU computation. Our implementation provides significant performance improvement so we can easily use it to solve dense linear system."

abstract = {GPU-accelerated computing is becoming a popular technology due to the emergence of techniques such as OpenACC, which makes it easy to port codes in their original form to GPU systems using compiler directives, and thereby speeding up computation times relatively simply. In this study we have developed an OpenACC implementation of the high order finite difference CFD solver ESSENSE for simulating compressible flows. The solver is based on summation-by-part form difference operators, and the boundary and interface conditions are weakly implemented using simultaneous approximation terms. This case study focuses on porting code to GPUs for the most time-consuming parts namely sparse matrix vector multiplications and the evaluations of fluxes. The resulting OpenACC implementation is used to simulate the Taylor-Green vortex which produces a maximum speed-up of 61.3 on a single V100 GPU by compared to serial CPU version.},

abstract = {This paper considers a simple extension of the block Jacobi iterative method to an overlapping block structure. It is shown how enlarging a system of algebraic equations by including duplicate copies of several rows, leads to an efficient iterative scheme on a multiprocessor MIMD array. Convergence estimates are provided for a simple model problem. Numerical results are given for the method implemented on transputer arrays in a Meiko computing surface and these are shown to be consistent with the theory.}

    abstract = "{Numerical simulations of sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS) have made great progress over past decades to address important questions in earthquake physics. However, significant challenges in SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture, and aseismic slip, and understanding physical factors controlling observables such as seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing complexity of SEAS modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify codes and advance these simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact. In 2018, we initiated a community code‐verification exercise for SEAS simulations, supported by the Southern California Earthquake Center. Here, we report the findings from our first two benchmark problems (BP1 and BP2), designed to verify different computational methods in solving a mathematically well‐defined, basic faulting problem. We consider a 2D antiplane problem, with a 1D planar vertical strike‐slip fault obeying rate‐and‐state friction, embedded in a 2D homogeneous, linear elastic half‐space. Sequences of quasi‐dynamic earthquakes with periodic occurrences (BP1) or bimodal sizes (BP2) and their interactions with aseismic slip are simulated. The comparison of results from 11 groups using different numerical methods show excellent agreements in long‐term and coseismic fault behavior. In BP1, we found that truncated domain boundaries influence interseismic stressing, earthquake recurrence, and coseismic rupture, and that model agreement is only achieved with sufficiently large domain sizes. In BP2, we found that complexity of fault behavior depends on how well physical length scales related to spontaneous nucleation and rupture propagation are resolved. Poor numerical resolution can result in artificial complexity, impacting simulation results that are of potential interest for characterizing seismic hazard such as earthquake size distributions, moment release, and recurrence times. These results inform the development of more advanced SEAS models, contributing to our further understanding of earthquake system dynamics.}",

abstract = {Abstract Recent investigations have provided new and significantly revised constraints on the subsurface structure of the Ventura-Pitas Point fault system in southern California; however, few data directly constrain fault surfaces below ~6 km depth. Here, we use geometrically complex three-dimensional mechanical models driven by current geodetic strain rates to test two proposed subsurface models of the fault system. We find that the model that incorporates a ramp geometry for the Ventura-Pitas Point fault better reproduces both the regional long term geologic slip rate data and interseismic GPS observations of uplift in the Santa Ynez Mountains. The model-calculated average reverse slip rate for the Ventura-Pitas Point fault is 3.5 ± 0.3 mm/yr, although slip rates are spatially variable on the fault surface with > 8 mm/yr predicted on portions of the lower ramp section at depth.},

abstract = {Summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference methods have several desirable properties for second-order wave equations. They combine the computational efficiency of narrow-stencil finite difference operators with provable stability on curvilinear multiblock grids. While several techniques for boundary and interface conditions exist, weak imposition via simultaneous approximation terms (SATs) is perhaps the most flexible one. Although SBP methods have been applied to elastic wave equations many times, an SBP-SAT method for general anisotropic elastic wave equations has not yet been presented in the literature. We fill this gap by deriving energy-stable self-adjoint SBP-SAT methods for general anisotropic materials on curvilinear multiblock grids. The methods are based on fully compatible SBP operators. Although this paper focuses on classical SBP finite difference operators, the presented boundary and interface treatments are general and apply to a range of methods that satisfy an SBP property. We demonstrate the stability and accuracy properties of a particular set of fully compatible SBP-SAT schemes using the method of manufactured solutions. We also demonstrate the utility of the new method in elastodynamic cloaking and seismic imaging in mountainous regions.}

These methods can be derived solving a system of nonlinear equations for its coefficients. To achieve this, we usually admit various simplifying assumptions. The most common of them are the so-called row simplifying assumptions. Here we neglect them and present an algorithm for the construction of Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4 based only in the first column simplifying assumption. The result is a pair that outperforms other known pairs in the bibliography when tested to the standard set of problems of DETEST. A cost free fourth order formula is also derived for handling dense output.}
