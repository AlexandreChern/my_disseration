\section{Rate-and-state friction law}
% \subsection{Rate-and-state friction law}

For most materials, it has been revealed by laboratory experiments on frictional sliding that the following conditions exist:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The resistance to sliding depends on the sliding rate at steady rate, along with a logarithmic dependency of the coefficient of friction on the slip rate
    \item The resistance to sliding increases to a transient peak value when the imposed slip rate is suddenly changed, with the peak value being a logarithmic function of the slip rate
    \item The friction coefficient is approximately a linear function with the logarithmic of the time in hold-and-slip experiments.
\end{itemize}

Laboratory measurements at slow sliding rates can be reproduced relatively well with a rate-and-state formalism on the order of microns per second.
Various laws have been proposed (\cite{https://doi.org/10.1029/JB084iB05p02161, https://doi.org/10.1029/JB084iB05p02169,https://doi.org/10.1029/JB088iB12p10359,annurev:/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.earth.26.1.643}).

One common such law is called aging law
\begin{align}
    \mu &= \mu_* + (a - b) \ln \frac{V}{V_*} \\
    \frac{d\theta}{dt} &= 1 - \frac{V\theta}{D_c}
\end{align}
At steady state, the law is purely rate dependent
\begin{equation}
    \mu_{ss} = \mu_{*} + (a - b) \ln \frac{V}{V_*}
\end{equation}

For a single-degree-of-freedom system such as a spring-and-slider system, the stability analysis shows that the slip can be stable only if $a - b > 0$ and that unstable slip requires $a - b < 0$  
%(\cite{Priestley_1990}). 
For unstable slip to occur, it requires $a - b$ is smaller than a critical negative value, defining an intermediate domain of conditional stability.
For a crack with size L embedded in an elastic medium with shear modulus $G$, the condition for unstable slip is 
\begin{equation}
    a - b < - \lambda \frac{GD_c}{L\sigma_n'}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is on the order of unity. 
$\sigma_n'$ is the effective normal stress with $\sigma_n' - \sigma_n - P$ where $P$ is pore pressure.
In the limit when the pore pressure becomes near lithostatic, the critical value becomes infinite.
This implies that high pore pressure should promote stable slip through the reduction of the effective normal stress.
The rate-and-state friction and many definitions here are important concepts in the earthquake cycle simulations that are going to be discussed in later chapters.
